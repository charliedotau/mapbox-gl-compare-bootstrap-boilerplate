# Intro - Mapbox GL Compare and Bootstrap together

This repo shows `Mapbox GL JS` with [Mapbox GL Compare](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/mapbox-gl-compare/) and `Bootstrap` playing nicely together.

This repo can be used as a kind of boilerplate for new `Mapbox GL Compare / Bootstrap` projects.

# Beg, borrow, steal

This project borrows heavily - read steals from - this `Codepen`: [http://codepen.io/technoloG/pen/vKZNao](http://codepen.io/technoloG/pen/vKZNao)
